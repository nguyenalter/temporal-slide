# Lack of utility methods

Can not help solve these problems without writing a bunch of code:
<v-click>

- Get the duration between two date

  Example: How many days have passed since last Christmas?

</v-click>
<v-click>

- Custom format the output date string to the end user

  Example: dbdbdiagram shows version history date
  <img src="/dbdiagram-version-history.png" class="h-15" />
</v-click>
<v-click>

- Add or subtract the date

  Example: dbdiagram's Team Plan has 7-day free trial. When does the trial end?
  <img src="/dbdiagram-trial-team-plan.png" class="h-20" />

</v-click>
