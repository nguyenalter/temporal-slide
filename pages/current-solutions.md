|  Solution   |   Pros  | Cons |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Write custom util methods | - Easy to customize for our own use cases | - Require development and maintenance <br> - Error-prone |
| Use third-party libraries | - Easy-to-use APIs <br> - Many utility methods <br> - Support Timezone <br> - Support Localization | - Rely on 3rd party libraries |

<!-- | Use Date + Intl API | - Support Timezone <br> - Support Localization | - Hard-to-use APIs <br> - Lack of utility methods <br> - No custom parse and format | -->

=> At the moment, we prefer to use third-party libraries to solve Date/Time problems
