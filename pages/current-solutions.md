Comparing the solutions:

|  Solution   |   Pros  | Cons |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Write custom util methods | - Understand what we wrote | - Take much time and effort <br> - May not cover all the edge cases |
| Use third-party libraries | - Easy-to-use APIs <br> - Many utility methods <br> - Support Timezone <br> - Support Localization | - There are many libraries out there |
| Use Intl API | - Support Timezone <br> - Support Localization | - Hard-to-use APIs <br> - Lack of utility methods |

=> At the moment, we prefer to use third-party libraries to solve Date/Time problems
